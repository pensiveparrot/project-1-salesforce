##### With the end user in consideration being a franchise owner, franchisees can now auth in to manage financials and pull customer and worker financial data on a given date.
###### TODO(For any changes to come):
####### Fix logic(Why doesn't date have any impact on SOQL select?  Shouldn't it be a major identifier to the relationship query?)
